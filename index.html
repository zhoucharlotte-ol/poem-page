                <p>Maya Angelou is an author of memoirs and essays, a poet, and a civil rights activist. "Still I Rise" is the titular poem for Angelou's book of poetry, <em>And Still I Rise</em>, which was written when she was already well-established in her career. With the poem, Angelou showcases her resilience and ability to celebrate herself in the face of hatred and racism. The poem was used by the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) in their advertising campaign for Black education in 1994.</p>

                <p>
                    You may write me down in history
                    <br>
                    With your bitter, twisted lies,
                    <br>
                    You may trod me in the very dirt
                    <br>
                    But still, like dust, I'll rise.

                <p>
                    Does my sassiness upset you?
                    <br>
                    Why are you beset with gloom?
                    <br>
                    'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
                    <br>
                    Pumping in my living room.

                <p>
                    Just like moons and like suns,
                    <br>
                    With the certainty of tides,
                    <br>
                    Just like hopes springing high,
                    <br>
                    Still I'll rise.

                    Did you want to see me broken?
                    <br>
                    Bowed head and lowered eyes?
                    <br>
                    Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
                    <br>
                    Weakened by my soulful cries?

                    <br>
                    Don't you take it awful hard
                    <br>
                    'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
                    <br>
                    Diggin' in my own backyard.

                    <br>
                    You may cut me with your eyes,
                    <br>
                    You may kill me with your hatefulness,
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Does it come as a surprise
                    <br>
                    That I dance like I've got diamonds
                    <br>
                    At the meeting of my thighs?

                    Out of the huts of history's shame
                    <br>
                    I rise
                    <br>
                    Up from a past that's rooted in pain
                    <br>
                    I rise
                    <br>
                    I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
                    <br>
                    Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

                    Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
                    <br>
                    I rise
                    <br>
                    Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
                    <br>
                    I rise
                    <br>
                    Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
                    <br>
                    I am the dream and the hope of the slave. <!--double check the order of dream and hope with yt video chose-->
